Can you create an invoice header in the fo format used by apache fop?
Do you have any suggestion on how to write the invoice main body?
Thank you, do you have a suggestion for the invoice footer?
How would the main document look? Can you add the above pieces as placeholders so I could 
stitch them together later?
Can you give me an example of the data document that will be applied to this tranform?
Seems the template for the customer and company is missing, can you create that as well?
